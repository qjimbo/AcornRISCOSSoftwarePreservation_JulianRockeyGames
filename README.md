# Julian Rockey's Games
Archive of Acorn Archimedes RISC OS Games by Julian Rockey, also known as "J.Rockey". To download an ADF image of these games, [click here](https://github.com/jameshansen/JulianRockeyGames/releases).

# Background
My father was a teacher at Shrewsbury School for many decades, and has always been an avid supporter of Acorn Computers. Julian Rockey was a former student at the school, and somewhere along the way, my father ended up with a acorn formatted floppy disk that contained games coded or enhanced by Julian Rockey in the late 1980s. I played many of these games on Archimedes machines growing up all the time, forming part of my childhood memories, but to this day I have no idea if I had the only copy or if they were more widespread.

Around 2003-2004, I emailed Julian Rockey about these games, asking if I could release the games on my website, as well as if he had the original Maps for **Battletanx**, as the originals became corrupted (the **MAZES** ones included are new ones I created along with my step-father). I no longer have his reply email, but I remember that he was happy for me to distribute the games at that time, which is why I feel that it is OK for me to upload them here again, as my website is no longer online. He said that the original maps were on a computer in his attic, so was not able to retreive them.

Upon recently researching again, I found a [go-fund-me](https://www.gofundme.com/f/fund-for-bump) that indicated Julian passed away in 2019, aged 47. After seeing this tragic news, I felt compelled to get these games out there, so they aren't completely lost to time.

These are a fantastic example of the early computer programming revolution, with talented programmers like Julian able to craft their own computer games and share them at a young age. Julian went on to release Quazer for the Achimedes commercially in 1988.

# Lost Data and Contact
As mentioned above, the original BattleTanx mazes / maps were lost. This game appears to be an original, not an enhancement (asides from maybe a ZX Spectrum release?) so it's likely they may be gone forever, but if you have a copy, please let me know.

To load my Battletanx mazes, click **New Mazes** type in **MAZES** and press enter.

I also appear to have lost the Archenoid screens as well, as the "Screens" data file is all blank. As this appears to be a customized version of another game to add a map editor, the originals might be out there but searching **Archenoid** on google doesn't yield any information about this game.

To load my Archenoid screens, Press 4 and type in **Newscreens** and press enter.

If you have any more information on these games, or the original untouched mazes, maps or screens, feel free to reach out to me at **qjimbo@gmail.com**.

## BUGames
The disk has the label **BUGames** and contained a **Games** folder, with the following files (descriptions taken from the beginning of each file and from inside !Menu)

* **!Menu**: Menu for Archimedes (Version 1), Written by Julian Rockey on 28 Dec 1987, acts as a launcher for the other games: Archenoid, Battletanx,Lander, Missile Command and Stellar.
  
* **Archenoid**:
  
"An extended version of Breakout, with multiple screens, more features and a screen designer."

Written by Keith McAlpine with help from Gem Electronics and extended/modified by Julian Rockey, Title screen also credits A&B Computers

* **Battletanx**:
  
"A simple two player tank game, where you can fight your opponent in pre-defined mazes or build your own."

Archimedes BBC BASIC V version by Julian Rockey, "Battletanx / (c) SquidSoft 1984-1988. Also available for B/B+/Master and RML 480Z by Julian Rockey, and ZX Spectrum by James Williams produced by Electrosoft."

Archimedes BBC BASIC V version by Julian Rockey and James Williams, Started 16 Dec 1987 ... Finished 27 Dec 1987

* **Stellar**:

"Guide your spaceship to land on 15 different pads, and then do it at different gravities!"

'Stellar Rescue' from The Micro User, Archimedes Enhancement: J.Rockey.
(BBC Micro version originally written by	Andrew Smith and included on a cover disk for The Micro User magazine - Micro User Vol.3, No.3 - May 1985)
